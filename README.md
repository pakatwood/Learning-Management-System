# Software Engineering Project

The following is a Capstone project creating a Learning Management System.
The Learning management system showcases two different views, an Admin (Administrator) veiw and a User veiw (Student).

The following is a link to a google doc with a summerize presentation: (https://prezi.com/p/edit/pdraynw3mnhb/).


There are 2 types of user accounts. One is for ADMIN and the second is for STUDENT. In this version, ADMIN is able to Manage Courses (Insert, Delete, or Update a Course), Manage Students (Insert, Delete, or Update a Student), and Manage Student Courses (Assign Courses to or Withdraw Courses from Student). ADMIN is also able to assign exam and course grades, however, this feature is still under construction in this version. The STUDENT account is accessible by registered students. STUDENT can see their Class Schedule on their Home Page and they only have the "Student Records & Enrollment" option available at the moment. On the "Student Records & Enrollment" page, students can see their information at the top left corner. On the top right side, students can see the registered courses they are taking for the current semester. On the bottom left side, students can select a course for which they want to see their exam grades. On the bottom right side, students can see their course grades if the ADMIN has assigned a letter grade for a course. Students still have to option to enter a letter grade to calculate their projected GPA for the semester.
